# Second-Integrative-Task-DIS

Daniel Alejandro Castro y Katerine Valens

Considerations for playing the game:
•	The coordinate provided for the pipe must be a valid coordinate, within the range of the board.
•	The type of pipe selected must be a valid type of pipe.
•	There must be only one path from the water source to the drain. 
•	The user must not place pipes next to their path from the water source to the drain, as it could cause their solution to count as not valid

-The program uses java fx, this means that is neccesary to have this libraries installed and also for the test packages is necesary to have Junit installed.
- The bfs structure algorithm is implemented in the class of the game for each graph.In base controller por the list graph and in matrix game controller for the matrix graph
